## General Information
- This project focuses on predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques. The primary goal is to assist real estate agents and potential buyers in making informed decisions based on various house features.
- The background involves analyzing various factors that could influence house prices, such as location, size, and the presence of certain amenities.
- The business problem addressed here is the challenge of accurately predicting house prices in a dynamic real estate market to aid in buying, selling, and investment decisions.
- The dataset used comprises various house attributes along with their corresponding prices. It includes both numerical and categorical data, providing a comprehensive view of the factors affecting house prices.

## Conclusions
- Our analysis yielded several key insights into factors significantly influencing house prices. (Details of specific conclusions would be added based on the outcomes of your analysis, e.g., the impact of location, size, and specific amenities on the price.)
- The regression models employed demonstrated varying degrees of accuracy, with certain models performing better based on the metrics evaluated.
- The presence of outliers and the importance of data cleaning were evident, significantly impacting the accuracy of our predictions.
- Future directions could include incorporating more granular data and exploring more complex models to enhance prediction accuracy.
